    "finition": "Lime finish",

    "avantage-2": "1. Energetic efficiency",
    "avantage-3": "Hemp concrete, coated with a natural finish, has the advantage of acting as a very effective thermal mass. Hemp houses are temperate, we enjoy an ambient temperature of 21 degrees throughout the year without intensive energy cost.",
    "avantage-4": "2. Outstanding durability",
    "avantage-5": "Hemp concrete will continuously petrify over time, like stone, to solidify. It is a non-flammable wall that is not attacked by rodents and allows occupant to intervene more quickly in case of disaster.",
    "avantage-6": "3. Ecological factor",
    "avantage-7": "In Quebec, hemp concrete is made from 100% natural ingredients. Studies have shown that a hemp house of average size can recover up to 6.5 tons of CO2 in the atmosphere inside its walls.",
    "avantage-8": "4. Air quality",
    "avantage-9": "The current houses are very well insulated. The problem is precisely that they do not allow an exchange of air, which is reflected by a pollution of the ambient air. For its part, the hemp wall breathes and allows an exchange of air.",
    "avantage-10": "5. Overall comfort",
    "avantage-11": "Hygrometric control allows the hemp concrete wall to intuitively regulate the relative humidity in the air. Also, we enjoy excellent sound insulation.",
